# HopeBridge Nonprofit CRM + Automation (Salesforce Portfolio Project)

This is a portfolio project demonstrating a complete Salesforce CRM implementation for a fictional nonprofit organization, HopeBridge Outreach. The system is built using the Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) to streamline the management of donors, volunteers, and clients, while automating key tasks using Salesforce Flows.

## Project Purpose

Nonprofits often struggle to manage donor relationships, volunteer engagement, and service delivery using spreadsheets or disconnected tools. This demo CRM centralizes all key operations and introduces automation to reduce manual admin tasks.

## Project Overview

HopeBridge Outreach is a nonprofit serving communities by providing food access and mental wellness support. This project configures Salesforce to manage the nonprofit's activities, such as tracking donations, volunteers, client services, and automating administrative tasks. The implementation utilizes NPSP for managing contacts, donations, and campaigns, with additional automation provided through Salesforce Flows.

The project focuses on building an easy-to-use Salesforce system for nonprofits with limited technical capacity, aimed at reducing administrative overhead and improving engagement tracking. This CRM implementation can help HopeBridge Outreach run more efficiently by automating tasks such as donor follow-ups, event reminders, and campaign reporting.
