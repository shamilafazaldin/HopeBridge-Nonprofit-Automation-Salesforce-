## üìÑ Project Summary ‚Äì Hopbridge Outreach (Salesforce NPSP)

**Hopbridge Outreach** is a fictional nonprofit organization supporting underserved communities through wellness programs and food assistance.

This project demonstrates how a Salesforce Admin can implement a simple yet powerful CRM system for a small nonprofit using the **Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP)**. The solution focuses on tracking relationships, managing service types, and automating follow-ups to ensure no one falls through the cracks.

### üéØ Problem We‚Äôre Solving

Small nonprofits often lack the time, skills, or budget to set up CRMs that match their workflows. Staff rely on spreadsheets or email to track donor or client interactions ‚Äî leading to:
- Missed follow-ups
- Poor reporting
- Limited visibility into outreach efforts

### ‚úÖ Our Goal

Build a lean, functional Salesforce CRM with:
- Clean data model tailored to nonprofit needs
- Custom fields for key information (e.g., service type, constituent role)
- Automations to trigger follow-up tasks
- Simple dashboards to track outreach and services

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Features Used

- **Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP)** ‚Äì preconfigured CRM for nonprofits
- **Salesforce Flows** ‚Äì to automate follow-up reminders
- **Custom Fields & Layouts** ‚Äì to capture what matters most
- **Reports & Dashboards** ‚Äì for clear visibility into outreach
- **GitHub** ‚Äì for project documentation
- **Loom & Screenshots** ‚Äì for visual walkthroughs

### üéâ What We‚Äôll Deliver

By the end of this project, we will have:
- A working Salesforce nonprofit org with customizations
- Automated follow-up Flow for better engagement
- A portfolio-ready GitHub repo with clear documentation
- Reusable structure for similar nonprofit client projects

## Step 3 ‚Äì Customize Contact Object

- Added custom fields:
  - Constituent Role (Donor, Volunteer, Client, Staff)
  - Service Type (Food, Wellness, Both)
  - Follow-Up Date (Date field)
- Updated Contact Page Layout to display new fields

## Added Custom Fields to Contact

We customized the Contact object to include fields that reflect our nonprofit‚Äôs needs.

- **Constituent Role (Picklist):** Donor, Volunteer, Recipient, etc.
- **Service Type (Picklist):** Food Support, Wellness Coaching, etc.
- **Follow-Up Date (Date):** Next check-in date for each contact

These fields help categorize and schedule outreach with individuals served.

## Add Custom Fields to Page Layout

We added our three custom fields to the standard Contact Layout so users can easily view and update important data:

- **Constituent Role** ‚Äì The individual‚Äôs role in the nonprofit (e.g., Donor, Volunteer)
- **Service Type** ‚Äì The type of service they‚Äôre receiving (e.g., Food Support, Wellness Coaching)
- **Follow-Up Date** ‚Äì The next scheduled contact or outreach date

All fields were added under the main Contact Information section.

## Step 4 ‚Äì Record-Triggered Flow: Auto-Follow-Up Task (Contact)

This Flow ensures that important follow-up actions are not missed during community outreach.

It watches for **new Contact records** where a **Follow-Up Date** is provided, and automatically creates a **Task** for the team to follow up with that contact on the specified date.

### Flow Trigger Settings:
- Object: Contact
- Trigger: Record is Created
- Condition: Follow_Up_Date__c Is Null = False
- Optimization: Actions and Related Records

This supports better engagement and continuity for both food and wellness program participants.

### Step 4B ‚Äì Configure "Create Follow-Up Task" Element

We configured the **Create Records** element to generate a Task assigned to the current user, reminding them to follow up with the new contact.
**Field Mappings:**


- **Subject**: `Follow up with {!$Record.FirstName}` *(Formula resource: `FollowUpTaskSubject`)*
- **Due Date Only**: `Triggering Contact ‚Üí Follow_Up_Date__c`
- **Assigned To ID**: `$User ‚Üí Id` *(or use a variable if $User.Id is not selectable)*
- **Name ID**: `Triggering Contact ‚Üí Contact ID`
- **Status**: `Not Started`
- **Priority**: `Normal`
- **Description**: `Follow-up scheduled during intake.`

This improves internal task management and ensures timely follow-ups with newly added contacts.
